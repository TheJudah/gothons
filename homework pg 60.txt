6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
== is equal to, while = is the assingment operator

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
a condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value
you might use one to check if you should trigger a part of your program to run.
for example, if the player is in the room, then make the orcs attack, 

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0  // it's own block

if spam == 10: 
    print('eggs') //a new block of code
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon') //this indent indicates the third block
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, 
prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! 
if anything else is stored in spam.

 if spam == 1: 
    print('Hello')
    if spam == 2 :
        print('Howdy') 
    else:
        print('Greetings!')
    print('Greetings!')
print(spam)

10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
[ctrl] - C

11. What is the difference between break and continue?

break stops the flow and breaks out of the thing, continue skips a step and keeps going.

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

range 10 goes from 

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 
using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that 
prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

14. If you had a function named bacon() 
inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
