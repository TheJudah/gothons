1. What is []?
Two square brackets; an empty list.

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam?
(Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
pam.insert(2, 'hello')


For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

3. What does spam[int('3' * 2) / 11] evaluate to?
Error out, as list indices must be integers or slices, not floats


4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
['d']

5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
[2, 4]

For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
1

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
+=, *=

10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
append adds whatevers in the argument to the *end* of the list while insert() inserts a value into the list. In an insert command, the first argument is which list to inster into, and the second argument is *what* to insert


11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
remove() removes the first value in the list, defined by the specific value in its argument. del removes whatever is at the index typed after del.

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
you can both index them, slice them, put them in a stew, use them in for loops, use them in len(), use them with "in" and "not" operators.

13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
Tuples are typed with parentheses (), lists typed with brackets[]
You can modify whats in a list, but you cannot modify individual values a tuple. 
A tuple with a single value must have a comma after it 

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
(42 ,)


15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?
tuple(['thats', 'just', 'like'])
list(('your', 'opinion', 'man'))

16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?
They cocntain references to the list values. 

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
copy.copy() takes the mutable value of whatever is in the argument and
assigns a new instance of that value to another variable. copy.deepcopy()
is used if you value contains a list of lists, and you want to duplicate the
lists inside your list.
