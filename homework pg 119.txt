1. What does the code for an empty dictionary look like?
emptyDictionary = {}

2. What does a dictionary value with a key 'foo' and a value 42 look like?
this example =  {'foo': 42}


3. What is the main difference between a dictionary and a list?
A: lists are ordered, dictionaries have keys but can be in any order, so you can't slice them up the same way


4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?
A: you'd get a return of False because it's not there. 


5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?
If 'cat' is in spam, it will return true. But if 'cat' is not a key, then it will return false with spam.keys()

6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?
If 'cat' is in spam, it will return true. But if 'cat' is not a value, then it will return false with spam.values()

if 'color' not in spam:
     spam['color'] = 'black'
